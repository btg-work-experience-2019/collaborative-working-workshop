# collaborative-working-workshop

Source code for the collaborative working workshop

Engineers are expected to:
* Clone this repo onto their development machines
* Configure git if global config is not applied
* Make the specified changes to the source code in a branch
* Create a PR to the master branch
* Assist in code review of other commits
* Merge their approved changes to master

Great engineers are expected to:
* Create a class in the `src/` directory with a `print_name()` method, which will return their name
* Add a unit test to verify that the method returns their name
* Run tests locally to verify that the tests pass
* Commit the code to a new branch and create a Pull-Request to have the code reviewed
* See the results of the tests running in Travis on the PR page

**Note:** Travis is set up already, so the tests should start automatically.
